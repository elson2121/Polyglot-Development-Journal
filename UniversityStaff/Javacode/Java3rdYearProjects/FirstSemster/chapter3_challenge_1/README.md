# Chapter3_Challenge_BrandedWeatherWidget

### Company I Pick
I choose **EcoLife Solutions**. This company is about nature and green things.

### Design
* **Colors**: I use light green and dark green. Green is for environment. 
* **Fonts**: I use **Verdana** for titles. It look friendly and easy to read for people. 
* **Layout**: I use `BorderPane`. The city is at top, weather in middle, and forecast at bottom.

### Reflection
1. **Brand Alignment**: My widget use green colors and a leaf. This match the company because they like nature. I also add a tip for gardening.
2. **CSS Architecture**: External CSS is good because it separate the style from the code. If I want to change color I go to CSS file only.
3. **Integration Challenge**: It was hard to make the `SVGPath` for the leaf shape and making the button disable with binding.

### Running
I use JavaFX for this. The refresh button only works when you type something in the box.
