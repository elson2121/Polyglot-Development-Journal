# Diary Manager Project - Ch 4 Challenge

this is my project for the diary manager. i use javafx to make the window. 
i try to make it look like the picture teacher show us. 

### how to use:
1. run the app and you see sidebar
2. click "New Entry" button (the + button) to make new note
3. type what you want and it save in the folder
4. search box help you find old notes fast

### things i did:
- make a sidebar for navigation
- use css to make colors like the photo
- use files api to save the diary to text files
- added a dark mode but it is simple
- background task for saving so the screen dont freeze

i had many trouble with the calendar part but i make a list instead because it was easier for me to code.
