Chapter 2 Challenge: The Applet Archaeologist
This project contains the BouncingTextApplet.java file, which demonstrates an exploration of the deprecated Java Applet technology by creating a simple animated text display.

Part 1: Code Overview
The BouncingTextApplet class achieves animation using a Thread:

init(): Sets the applet's size and background color.

start() / stop(): Manages the life cycle of the animation Thread.

run(): This is the animation loop. It continuously increases the text's x position, checks if it has moved off-screen to reset it, and calls repaint() to redraw the text every 100 milliseconds.

paint(Graphics g): Draws the String containing the developer's name at the text's current coordinates.

Part 2: Critical Analysis Answers
1. Security (The Sandbox Model)
Applets ran in a "sandbox", meaning they were restricted for security. Here are two things an applet would NOT be allowed to do on your computer:

Access Local Files: An applet could not read, write, or delete files on your hard drive (like your documents or system files) without special permissions. This was the main way to prevent an applet from stealing data or installing malware.

Run System Programs: An applet could not directly execute programs on your computer, such as launching an external calculator, opening your command prompt, or starting any application.

2. Modern Replacement
The need for Java Applets has been completely replaced by a combination of three modern web technologies:

HTML5: Provides the basic structure and elements (like the canvas).

CSS3: Handles the visual styling and, most importantly, smooth animation using tools like keyframes.

JavaScript (JS): Provides the programming logic to control elements, manage user input, and drive complex dynamic content and animation.

Example of Bouncing Text using Modern Technologies:

A simple bouncing animation is usually done with CSS3 and HTML5. You define the text in HTML, use CSS to position it, and then use a CSS @keyframes rule to automatically move the text from one side of the screen to the other in a loop. JavaScript would only be needed for very complex interaction or game logic.

3. Legacy
It is still important for a developer to know what applets are, even though they are deprecated, for three main reasons:

Understanding Security: Applets created the original concept of a secure client-side "sandbox". Modern security models for web browsers, mobile apps, and cloud functions are built on the same core ideas of restricted access.

Maintaining Old Systems: Many large companies and government organizations still have legacy systems that rely on old Applet code. Developers need to understand this technology to maintain or migrate these critical applications.

Historical Context of Concurrency: Applets taught developers about multi-threading in UI. They used the Runnable interface to separate the animation logic from the UI drawing, a fundamental concept in modern high-performance user interface development.
