# Diary Manager - Chapter 4 Challenge 2

this is my work for the second part of the chapter 4 challenge. 
i make a console app that can save files and read them back.

### how it works:
- when you write a note it saves in the entries folder
- the name of file has the date and time so it is unique
- you can search for words in old notes
- i added a backup button to make a zip file

i use the buffered reader and writer like the instructions said. 
also i use the nio files because it is better for making folders.
