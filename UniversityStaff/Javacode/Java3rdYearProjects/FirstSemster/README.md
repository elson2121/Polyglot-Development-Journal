Challenge 1.1: The Cryptic Message Decoder

Description:
This program decodes a cryptic message given as a positive integer by extracting specific digits, performing calculations (product of first and last digits, sum of second and second-last digits), and concatenating the results to form a final code.

Example Input/Output:
Input: 13579
Output: The decrypted code is: 910
Input: 12345
Output: The decrypted code is: 58

Reflection:
I learned how to use mathematical operations like division, modulus, and Math.log10 to extract specific digits from a number without loops or conditionals. The most challenging part was ensuring the correct extraction of the second and second-last digits, as it required careful calculation of the number of digits and appropriate division.
